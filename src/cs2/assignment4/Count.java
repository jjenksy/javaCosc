 * Created by johnjenkins on 5/4/17.
 * Write a recursive method (count) that finds the number of occurrences of a specified character in an array. You need to define the following two methods. The second one is a recursive helper method.
 public static int count(char[] chars, char ch)
 public static int count(char[] chars, char ch, int high)

 Write a test program (CharSearch) that prompts the user to enter a list of characters in one line, and then a character to count. Next, it displays the number of occurrences of the character in the list.
