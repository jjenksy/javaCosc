/**
 * Created by johnjenkins on 5/4/17.
 * Problem 1
 * Write a ternarySearch() method using recursion. A ternary search is similar to a binary search,
 * but it divides the array into three pieces rather than two. A ternary search finds the points
 * that divide the array into three roughly equal pieces, and then uses these points to determine where to search for the key.
 * The binary search method is shown in Listing 18.6 on page 716 of your textbook.
 * Create a main method that prompts the user for the size of the array and generates
 * it randomly. It should also prompt the user for the key (number that is to be searched for).
 * Then display the array, sort it (which is a pre-requisite for a ternary search) using either the
 * Java Sort method (java.util.arrays.Sort) or one youâ€™ve written, search for the key, and show where it is found (or not found).
 *
 * Modify the ternary search method implemented in problem #1 using a generic type. The search method looks like the following:
 * public static <E extends Comparable<E>> int ternarySearch(E[] list, E key)
 * Since the type extends Comparable, be sure to make comparisons using the compareTo method or equals method.
