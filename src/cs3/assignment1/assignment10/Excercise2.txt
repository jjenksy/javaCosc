Exercise 2. Let us consider an empty hashtable with 17 positions indexed from 0 to 16 which uses the
hashcode function given by h(k) = k % 17, using the separate chaining scheme. Illustrate the content
of the hashtable after inserting the elements 4, 10, 38, 21, 5, and 27, in this order.

Answer:
Separate chaining scheme is something in which each position has a link to avoid collisions we can use an Arraylist as the bucket to hold the values.

Below keys to be inserted ,

4%17=4

10%17=10

38%17=4

21%17= 4

5%17= 5

27%17=10

Here the elements 4,38,21 are colliding for the position index 4 and 10,27 are colliding for position 10 and 5 can be directly inserted without any collisions.

Inserts look as shown below using chaining - used for blanks where nothing inserted -> represents chaining:

16 -
15 -
14 -
13 -
12 -
11 -
10 10 -> 27 //10 and 27 inserted and chained
09 -
08 -
07 -
06 -
05 05 //05 inserted no collision so no chaining
04 04 -> 38 ->21 //04, 38 and 21 inserted and collisions occurs so chaining happens
