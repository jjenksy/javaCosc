Exercise 1. Please show the big O notation of the recurrence relation below (please show detailed steps
for full credits):
T(n) = T(n-1) + n
Answer:
O(n)

Exercise 2. What is the big O notation of the following program (please show detailed steps for full
credits):
for (int i=n; i>0; i-=2)
for (int j=i; j<n; j++)
 {//other constant time statements ;}
 Answer:
T(n) - T(0) = 1 + 2 + ... + (n-1) + n = n * (n+1) / 2 = O(n ^ 2)
