//    worst case and the best case for the first and second iterations:
//
//    Ans)Worst case vs. best case: Your algorithm has diï¬€erent runtimes on diï¬€erent inputs, and a lot of times we want to know how fast the algorithm runs on an input of a certain size. Worst case runtime means that you are feeding the worst possible input (of that size) into your algorithm. Best case runtime means that you are feeding the best possible input into your algorithm. For an input of size n, perhaps the worst case runtime is T(n) = 2n2 + 5, and the best case runtime is 3n.
