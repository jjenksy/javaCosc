Given the array [2 5 -1 9 4 0 -3 7 3 6 -6], describe the steps for the following sorting
algorithms:
a) Merge sort;
b) Quick sort;
c) Heap sort.

a) array [2 5 -1 9 4 0 -3 7 3 6 -6]

Merge Sort -

Sort the arrays and then merge them

A = [ 2 5 -1 9 4 0] , B =[-3 7 3 6 -6]

After Sorting A and B

A = [-1 0 2 4 5 9] and B = [-6 -3 3 6 7]

after merging we get

array = [-6 -3 -1 0 2 3 4 5 6 7 9]

b) quick sort

Quicksort let the initial pivot be 3 then after partitioning we get

array = [2 -1 0 -3 -6 3 5 9 4 7 6]

pivot = -3

sort both the array parts which are left and right side of the pivot using the same procedure that we have used for the bigger array

Finally after sorting both these parts the whole array will get sorted.

c) Heap sort

We form max heap so that we can find maximum element in O(1) time

We heapify the array first in O(n) time and then at every find the max element and will put it at the last of the array.

At every step we update heap accordingly in O(logn) time.

so for the given example after the first step maximum element 9 will lie at the end of the array

after second step 7 will lie at the second last position and so on

The overall procedure takes O(nlogn) time.
